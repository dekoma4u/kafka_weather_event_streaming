# Kafka Weather Event Streaming

![Analytics vs Transactions - API and Data Streaming with Apache Kafka](https://www.kai-waehner.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Apache-Kafka-Transactions-API-vs-Big-Data-Lake-and-Batch-Analytics.png)

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build an automated, real-time streaming ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline using Python, Kafka, and PostgreSQL. This project demonstrates how to handle real-time data ingestion, processing, and storage with a focus on data quality and pipeline automation.

## Project Overview

This project showcases:

- Streaming of real-time weather data for selected locations.
- Data cleaning and transformation within the pipeline.
- Message brokering with Kafka Producers and Consumers.
- Storage of processed data in a PostgreSQL database.
- Continuous data updates in a pre-modeled database for real-time analytics.

## Features

1. **Data Ingestion**: Real-time weather data from a Weather API.
2. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and formatting of data before storage.
3. **Message Brokering with Kafka**: Managing data flow with Kafka Producers and Consumers.
4. **Data Storage**: Storing data in a PostgreSQL database with an optimized schema.
5. **Error Handling and Logging**: Robust error management and logging for pipeline activities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Apache Kafka
- PostgreSQL
- Git
- smptlib (email libraries)
- API Key from [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dekoma4u/kafka_weather_event_streaming.git
cd kafka_weather_event_streaming
```

### Set Up Environment Variables

- Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
  - API credentials
  - Database connection details
  - Kafka server settings
  - Selected locations for weather data

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Up Kafka

- Install Apache Kafka.
- Start the Kafka server and create required topics.

### Configure PostgreSQL

- Set up the PostgreSQL database.
- Ensure the database connection parameters in the `.env` file are correct.
- Create the necessary table (`weather_data`) in the database.

### Run the Pipeline
At a failure, alerts is sent to the project owner.
  
- **Start the Kafka Producer** to stream weather data:

  ```bash
  python3 weather_api_producer.py
  ```

- **Start the Kafka Consumer** to process and store the data:

  ```bash
  python3 weather_api_consumer.py
  ```

## Usage

- The pipeline streams data at a set interval (default 5 minutes).
- Data is processed and inserted into the PostgreSQL database in real-time.
- The stored data can be accessed and analyzed using SQL queries.

## Considerations

- **Scalability**: Kafka supports horizontal scaling to manage increased data volumes.
- **Data Quality**: Ensure all data fields are correctly formatted before insertion.
- **Performance**: Consider table partitioning and indexing for large datasets.
